Program 1 : (CreditCard) This Java program validates an 8 or 9-digit credit card number by using a checksum algorithm. The CreditCard class performs checks on the card length, reverses the number, and calculates a position-based sum according to specific rules. The program verifies the final digit to determine if the card number is valid, outputting whether it is valid or invalid.

Program 2 : (Game) This Java program simulates a game called "Alphabet Wars" with two teams, Team A and Team B, each represented by letters with individual strengths. Players can optionally assign custom strengths to each letter, and the program then calculates scores based on input words, determining the winning team or if there's a tie. The Solver class handles score calculations and displays the winner based on total scores.

Program 1 : (Frequency) This Java program finds the top k most frequently occurring numbers from a list of user-input integers between 0 and 100. The Num class counts occurrences of each number, sorts them by frequency, and displays the k numbers with the highest occurrences. Input validation ensures that all numbers are within the specified range.

Program 2 : (Trade) This Java program calculates the maximum possible profit from two stock transactions using an array of stock prices. It tracks the minimum buy prices and maximum sell profits for both transactions to maximize returns. Input validation ensures at least two prices are provided before calculating profits.
